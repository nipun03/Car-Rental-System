# Car-Rental-System
Content:
In order to facilitate users to rent a car as and when required we would like to design a car rental
system. It is more feasible than owning a car and maintaining it. Car rental system serves people
who don't own a car, who are out of town or owners of damaged cars who are awaiting repair or
insurance compensation.
Scope:
1. Providing car catalog to the Users so that they can choose the best option based on their
concern.
2. Admin can manage the catalog by adding or removing the cars based on their availability
and allows only authorized Users (Driver License) to rent a vehicle
3. Admin must make sure that the rented cars must have valid insurance.
4. Admin must allow user to provide feedback at the end of every ride.
Objective:
1. To reduce the effort of booking a car in a conventional procedure.
2. To ease the search process of a customer who is in need of a car.
3. To provide services to the customers in order to achieve the best customer satisfaction.
